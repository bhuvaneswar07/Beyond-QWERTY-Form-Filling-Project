        "\n",
        "PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing framework designed for big data processing and analytics. It allows you to leverage the power of Spark using Python, making it easier to perform distributed data processing on large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features of PySpark:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fast Data Processing:** Built for handling big data efficiently using in-memory computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Distributed Computing:** Distributes tasks across a cluster of machines for parallel processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Support for Multiple Data Sources:** Works with structured and unstructured data, including CSV, JSON, Parquet, Hive, HDFS, etc.\n",
